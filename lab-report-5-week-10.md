# CSE 15L - Lab Report 5
In order to find the difference between the two tests, I ran my markdown parse on all the tests and saved the standard output to a test file.  
I repeat this process by running the provided implementation on the test files and writing the standard output to another test file.  
I run diff on the two files to receive this [result](/lab5-assets/diff.md)
